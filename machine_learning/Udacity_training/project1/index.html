You might have different questions about the 2017 StackOverflow survey data than I looked at earlier in the course. If you choose this dataset, you can not use the same questions that were analyzed earlier in the classroom.

Alternatively, if you felt pretty confident with the techniques in this lesson, you might be looking to push the envelope. In this case, you may choose to retrieve all of the Stack Overflow Survey - Multiple Years results. From this data, you could analyze trends over time.

<h3> 1. What languages were most popular in each year? </h3>

The following tables show the top 10 programming languages in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 
respectively.

<img src="./images/top_10_languages_2019.png" width="40%" alt="top 10 languages in 2017">
<br>
<img src="./images/top_10_languages_2020.png" width="40%" alt="top 10 languages in 2017">

<br>

The following tables and bar charts show the ranks of the programming languages 
Python and Java in terms of percentages of users. 

<br>

<br>
<img src="./images/java_ranks.png" width="30%" alt="python ranks">
<br>
<img src="./images/java_ranks_chart.png" width="30%" alt="python ranks chart">

<br>

It can be seen from the above tables and bar charts that Python becomes 
more and more polular over time, while the popularity of Java decreases 
over time.

<br>

<h3> 2. What databases were most popular in each year? </h3>

The following tables show the top 10 databases in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 
respectively. 

<br>

<img src="./images/top_10_db_2017.png" width="30%" alt="top 10 languages in 2017">
<br>
<img src="./images/top_10_db_2018.png" width="40%" alt="top 10 languages in 2017">
<br>
<img src="./images/top_10_db_2019.png" width="40%" alt="top 10 languages in 2017">
<br>
<img src="./images/top_10_db_2020.png" width="40%" alt="top 10 languages in 2017">

<br>

The following tables and bar charts show the ranks of the databases 
Oracle and PostgreSql in terms of percentages of users. 

<br>

<img src="./images/oracle_ranks.png" width="30%" alt="python ranks">
<br>
<img src="./images/oracle_ranks_chart.png" width="30%" alt="python ranks chart">
<br>
<img src="./images/postgresql_ranks.png" width="30%" alt="python ranks">
<br>
<img src="./images/postgresql_ranks_chart.png" width="30%" alt="python ranks chart">

<br>

It can be seen from the above tables and bar charts that PostgreSql becomes 
more and more polular over time, while the popularity of Oracle decreases 
over time.

<br>

<h3> 3. What countries were most popular in each year? </h3>

The following table show the top 10 countries in 2020.

<br>

<img src="./images/top_10_countries_2020.png" width="30%" alt="top 10 languages in 2017">
<br>

I observed that the top 10 countries remain the same in the last 4 years from 2017 to 2020.
