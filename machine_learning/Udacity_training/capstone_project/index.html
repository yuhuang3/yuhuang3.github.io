<p>
The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 caused tremendous equipment, materials deficiency and beds shortage problems in healthcare system across the U.S. [1]. The hospitals not only need to take care of the routine patients, but also need to take care of the sudden increased Covid-19 patients. A good planning and management of a hospital system becomes very important.
This article presents how new methods to use machine-learning to predict how long (in days) a Covid-19 patient needs to stay in a hospital at the time of admission. This can help hospital professionals to make an optimized planning for patient treatment and resources (e.g., room, bed, etc.) allocation. This also could reduce the amount of hospital visitors and so decrease the chance of staff and visitor infection.

<h2> 1. Data Understanding </h2>

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle's website [1]. There are three files used in this article:
train_data.csv: containing features related to patient, hospital and Length of stay (label)
test_data.csv: containing features related to patient, hospital. Need to predict the "length" of stay for each case id
train_data_dictionary.csv: containing the information of the features in train and test files.

As shown in Figure 1, there are total 17 features and 1 label column (Stay) in this dataset.
